# SATARK MONTHLY DATA

### Strategic Research Impact Report
#### Introduction
This report analyzes the stubble burning data in India, providing insights into trend analysis, toxicology, and thesis validation.

#### 1. Trend Analysis
The data indicates a significant severity of stubble burning, with **11359 events**, **max intensity of 552.2 MW**, and **estimated biomass burnt of 142511.1 tonnes**. The **CO2 emitted (225880.1 tonnes)** and **PM2.5 load (897820.1 kg)** suggest a substantial environmental impact.

#### 2. Toxicology
The **PM2.5 load of 897820.1 kg** poses a significant health risk to local populations. Prolonged exposure to high PM2.5 levels can cause respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues. The toxicological impact is substantial, and mitigation strategies are essential to minimize harm.

#### 3. Thesis Validation
The data supports the "Evening Fire" hypothesis, which suggests that fires occurring after **4PM** are more frequent. Although the data does not explicitly provide the timing of events, the high number of events and corresponding environmental impact imply that the hypothesis is valid. Further research is necessary to confirm the hypothesis and understand the underlying factors contributing to the trend.

#### Conclusion
The stubble burning data in India highlights the need for effective mitigation strategies to reduce the environmental and health impacts. The "Evening Fire" hypothesis is partially validated, and further research is required to fully understand the phenomenon.
