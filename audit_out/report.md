# SATARK ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE ASSESSMENT

# Monthly Strategic Ecological Impact Report
## For the West Bengal Sector, December 2025
### Introduction to the Report
The following report is a comprehensive analysis of the ecological impact of fire events in the West Bengal sector for the month of December 2025. It outlines the severity of the fire season, atmospheric toxicity, public health risks, ecological damage, and suggests strategic interventions to mitigate these effects.

## 1. **Executive Summary**
The West Bengal sector has experienced a severe fire season in December 2025, with:
* Total Fire Events: 5723
* Peak Thermal Intensity: 401.8 MW
* Estimated Biomass Incinerated: 53666.5 Tonnes
* CO2 Injection (Atmosphere): 85061.5 Tonnes
* PM2.5 Aerosol Load (Toxic Smog): 335952.5 kg
These metrics indicate a high level of ecological disruption and potential health risks to the local population.

## 2. **Atmospheric Toxicity & Public Health**
The PM2.5 aerosol load of 335952.5 kg poses significant health risks, including:
* Respiratory problems: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Cardiovascular diseases: heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular conditions
The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) implications suggest a reduction in visibility and an increase in atmospheric heating, exacerbating the greenhouse effect.
Key health concerns:
* Increased hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases
* Reduced lung function in vulnerable populations (children, elderly, asthmatics)
* Potential long-term effects: cancer, neurodegenerative diseases

## 3. **Ecological Damage Assessment**
The carbon footprint of 85061.5 Tonnes CO2 contributes to climate change, with far-reaching consequences:
* Soil degradation: loss of Nitrogen and Phosphorus due to stubble burning, reducing soil fertility and affecting future crop yields
* Water pollution: runoff from burned areas can contaminate water sources, harming aquatic ecosystems
* Biodiversity loss: habitat destruction and fragmentation, leading to population decline and extinction of native species

## 4. **Strategic Intervention**
To reduce the ecological impact of fire events in the next month, we recommend the following science-backed solutions:
* **Happy Seeder technology**: a machine that can cut and collect stubble, reducing the need for burning and promoting sustainable agriculture practices
* **Bio-decomposers**: microbial solutions that can decompose organic matter, reducing the amount of biomass available for burning and minimizing soil degradation
These solutions can help mitigate the effects of fire events, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote ecological sustainability in the West Bengal sector.
